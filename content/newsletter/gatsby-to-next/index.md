# Gatsby to Next

Hello, fellow pineapples,

Welcome to the fifth issue of the Pragmatic Pineapple newsletter!

I'm Nikola from the Pragmatic Pineapple blog and I will try to keep this newsletter reach you more often than before. My plan is to share recent updates from my blog, plus, give you some extra resources. I will share useful articles, videos, or any kind of content that I found interesting in between the newsletter issues. Let me know what you think about it.

Let's start with what is new on the blog.

## ✨ New on the blog

### How to Migrate Your Blog from Gatsby to Next.js

The piece I wrote for AppSignal last year, but it got published this year. In any case, it is a good read and it might help you decide which framework out of these two to use. I put great time and effort into it, hope it is useful to some of y'all.

### Add Newsletter Subscription Form to React Website

I don't like to put 3rd party code on my website. Most of the time it is mangled, you don't know what it does, and it just a uncomfortable for me. Because of that, I decided to build and share with you how you can build a custom sign up form for your own newsletter in React. The approach favors React, but it is easily customizable to any other React, but it is easily customizable to any other library/framework you are using.

### Share Buttons

When I started the Pragmatic Pineapple blog, I shared one article to my friend and he immediately asked - 'Where are the share buttons?'. He wanted to share it, but didn't have any shortcuts to do it.

The problem of share buttons bothered me for a while in my head, and I decided to take some time to make them. I still didn't write how exactly I did it, but I will in the future. For now, you can view them at the bottom of every blog post. They look like this:

## 📚 Useful Resources

To not clog you with links, I will share just one, but very valuable to me.

### [How to Disagree](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html)

Useful blog post that is good to read from time to time. As a part of our daily life and work, we need to disagree at times. It is good to keep yourself in check and do it properly. Also, it is a valuable guide to recognize how is somebody disagreeing with you.

### [Nailing an Interview with Vim](https://youtu.be/mZWsyUKwTbg)

OK, I lied, one more. This one is a video of how you can nail an interview by using Vim. It is by Ben Award and it is for all my Vim folks out there, I'm sure you'll love it.

## 🏔 Summing up

Thanks for reading this, you are my inspiration. Respond if something resonated with you (or it strognly didn't), I love hearing feedback.

Until next time, your fellow pineapple,
