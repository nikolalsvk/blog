- Software:
  - If you've been reading the blog, you already know [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is my editor of choice. I learned it at the beginning of my professional career and it's been amazing to me.
  - I'm a Mac user, so [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) does the job perfectly.
  - [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
  - [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
  - [fig](https://fig.io/)
  - [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) has been good to me. I like that it blocks ads out of the box.
  - Sometimes, you have to test some APIs or make WebSocket connections. Right about then, I roll out [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to do it.
  - To let people schedule a call with me, I use [Calendly](https://calendly.com/nikolalsvk).
  - To manage my newsletter - [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com?lmref=EVgZiQ) is awesome.
