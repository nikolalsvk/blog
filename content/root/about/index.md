title: About Nikola
---

Hi 👋. I am Nikola and I run the [Pragmatic Pineapple](/) tech blog you are currently reading. My goal is to educate, teach and question the status quo of [JavaScript](/tags/java-script) & [Ruby](/tags/ruby).

How? I break down complicated and overlooked JS & Ruby problems into actionable take-aways for beginners and advanced coders. That includes multiple perspectives which encourage my readers to reflect, evaluate and choose a solution that fits. All that explained in simple words to make both languages easy to apply.

My articles have appeared on the first page of [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=nikolalsvk), and blogs like [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/nikola-duza/), [AppSignal](https://blog.appsignal.com/), and [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/author/nikola). I've also been featured on newsletters like [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/), [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/), and [Node Weekly](https://nodeweekly.com/). I republish my posts on [dev.to](https://dev.to/nikolalsvk) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikolalsvk), so you can follow me there if you use those platforms.
